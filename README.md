# Recognizing Handwritten Digits Using SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
This project, titled "Recognizing Handwritten Digits Using SVD", was developed as part of the Numerical Linear Algebra module in collaboration with one of my peers during my undergraduate studies. The project leverages Python alongside libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, h5py, and OS for efficient data handling and visualization.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 7,291 training samples and 2,007 test samples of handwritten digits, providing a solid basis for model training and evaluation.
